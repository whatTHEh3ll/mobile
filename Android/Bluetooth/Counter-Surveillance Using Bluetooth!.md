## Transcript

**0:00** · Right now, without your knowledge, your phone is emitting a trackable radio signal. And this is particularly blatant with iPhones. Someone can actually drive by your house and see if you're home or if anyone is home. Someone can even see which part of the house you're in. In fact, someone would be able to see what part of the house everyone is in. You can see how dangerous this is, right? A burglar's dream. If you leave your house, you can be followed, but not at a close distance.

**0:32** · How about 100 to 200 meters? Can you tell you're being followed if it's that far? If you walk inside a building, someone could actually track your movements throughout the building. Planning on visiting a floor you're not authorized to go into?

**0:48** · Well, someone who knows how to do this tracking will be on you in an instant.

**0:52** · What about contact tracing? Yes, this can easily be used by some app to record who was near you or identify who you're with in real time. I can think of so many nefarious uses. Wait, this is not all about you being threatened. For a change, this knowledge can actually put you on the offense. How about this? You think someone is following you? Easy enough. You can actually see who's around you as identified by these same radio signals.

**1:19** · Is someone constantly present even as you move around a large area? H, that's suspicious. But now we can tell. You can identify their device and their exact location. Maybe he's hiding behind that building over there.

**1:39** · You notice this person is always just around the corner or the car is just slightly out of view or maybe someone stuck an air tag on you. So knowing about this can give you offensive information. Turn the tables on the bad guys. I call this counter surveillance.

**1:58** · What makes this possible is that all of you are emitting a radio signal that used to be hidden but it is not hidden any longer. As expected, many hackers have figured it all out and they now use this in ways one never thought about before. And if you know about this technology and understand it, you end up on top. You can use it for counter surveillance to protect yourself. You become the tracker. Those who do not know, well, you can only end up as the victim.

**2:30** · As they say, if you know, you know. If you want to be in the elite crowd, who knows? Stay right there.

**2:50** · What's going on?

**2:52** · What I'm going to talk about is a technology brought to wide use first by Apple then followed by Amazon and now by Google. So basically most production computing devices are part of this infrastructure and it is known as the Apple mesh network, Amazon sidewalk and the Google mesh network.

**3:16** · And what is happening here is that all devices enabled for these mesh networks are transmitting signals to each other directly peer-to-peer.

**3:24** · And this means that each device sends out announcements of their presence constantly, usually every 10 to 15 seconds. And these same devices are also listening to see if a signal belongs to the same mesh network. They receive and decrypt that signal and then they will retransmit it to the next pair device or send it over the internet. This technology is what is used to power the Apple Air Tag, Ring cameras, Amazon Echo, and Tile Trackers.

**3:52** · And in the future, it could power remote surveillance devices and drones. Allah Skynet.

**4:01** · The assumption made is that these devices will be used to create a separate communication layer that operates independently from the internet. However, what these companies did not plan on, and it should have been obvious, is that someone else could listen in on the signal. And though parts of the signal may be encrypted, other parts are not. And that makes it useful. I want you to first learn what this is all about.

**4:28** · Then later, I will teach you how to actually use these tools for offensive counter surveillance.

**4:38** · What is the technology?

**4:42** · The actual technology basis for all this is called Bluetooth low energy or BLE.

**4:48** · First of all, I want to make it clear this is not about hacking your phone.

**4:52** · Some of you are concerned about someone hacking your phone through Bluetooth like through the use of technologies like Apple AirDrop. Well, that is a possible concern since Airdrop also uses BLE. That is a different issue since that technology requires your permission to accept an airdrop. The main threat I'm talking about here is that your device is blindly doing BLE emissions constantly, all day, all night, every few seconds, and you have no input on this.

**5:23** · The devices that transmit these are all the Apple products from iPhones to Apple TV to Apple earphones. Then you have trackers like Air Tag and Tile.

**5:35** · Then you have wireless earphones and headphones. What about your car fog, your IoT enabled washer, dryer, and refrigerator? Your Amazon Echo, your Ring camera, and other security cameras.

**5:48** · The worst, of course, from a privacy viewpoint are the devices that move with you. Now, there are many apps that can track these emissions, and I'll discuss that later. Some years back, I wanted to write an app to do this with Wi-Fi, and I started that app, but got too busy.

**6:07** · Your phone also emits a Wi-Fi emission.

**6:10** · In fact, all phones emit a Wi-Fi signal, and this can in fact be used against you to do denial of service. You can be disconnected from the internet very easily. That was the app I was making, and I got that part running already, and I put the beginnings of it on GitHub.

**6:26** · But since then, BLE started to become commonplace. In fact, the only thing that was stopping the full adoption of BLE was Google. I think Google only enabled the Google Mesh network on Android a year ago. So now all modern phones emit this radio signal.

**6:47** · Technology description of BLE. I did a video on BLE in 2021 and then I did several videos on Skynet that actually specified BLE as the Skynet enabling technology. So if you search for Skynet on my channel, you'll find detailed explanations of BLE. There are other implications to BLE that I state in the Skynet videos. However, today I'm just going to give you a general description of what happens here.

**7:16** · Bluetooth low energy is the new powerful version of the old Bluetooth you've known since forever. The original Bluetooth is called Bluetooth classic and that's what powers your remote headphones, earphones, and portable speakers. I would not classify Bluetooth classic as dangerous. It is rather tame and really has limited effect on your devices. In order for one device to send audio to another, you have to simultaneously engage in pairing on both devices. So, it doesn't trigger without that.

**7:49** · If it's not searching for a device to pair, there's no obvious signal.

**7:54** · Typically, only some app can trigger it to send a signal. But Bluetooth Classic is very limited. Its range is no more than 15 ft typically or about 5 m. And because headphones and such devices need a continuous connection, this is typically heavy on the battery use of the portable device since it has to be always on while in use. Bluetooth low energy is completely different. First of all, Bluetooth low energy is a much more powerful signal. Indoors, it can easily handle 100 to 200 ft.

**8:27** · Outdoors, it can reach 600 ft or basically up to 200 m.

**8:33** · You might say, "Well, that's not intuitive. How can low energy have a longer range?" Well, you're misunderstanding the connotation of low energy. The way BLE works is that it is a fire and forget mechanism. The device will blindly send a message digitally encrypted via radio. The message is very short. Basically, it will just announce an ID and it will do this every few seconds. But the signal length is only in milliseconds.

**9:02** · So, a higher burst of energy is possible, but due to the shortness of the signal, it doesn't use up a lot of power. The message is sent without awaiting a response. This is what allows Air Tags to function for about a year on its batteries. observing real traffic from iPhones and Air Tags.

**9:22** · It appears that these Apple devices are sending a message every 12 seconds or so. Something to be aware of. Since potentially dozens of phones nearby can hear the message, each phone or device will capture the message and do a retransmit. At some point in the process, some device will signal that the message is received and sent to HQ.

**9:45** · that will then send a kill signal with the message so it doesn't get retransmitted again. Part of the signal is an announcement of who owns the signal infrastructure meaning which mesh network does it belong to. So it is then easier to identify which is an Apple mesh network device which is an Amazon sidewalk device and which is a Google mesh device. The signal also of course includes the command which is typically just an ID number if it's an air tag or tile tracker.

**10:15** · This part would be expected to be encrypted and it is for all these mesh networks. But on top of the signal is a location, a heading and a MAC address. And these are the pieces that make the signal unique and identifiable. For your own reference, the signal occurs around the 2.4 GHz zone which is near where 2.4 4 GHz Wi-Fi lives.

**10:38** · But if you want to trace this signal using an SDR, softwaredefined radio receiver, it will be very hard to see or decrypt because the signal is in milliseconds. Fortunately for us, phones already have the software built in to listen for BLE. Every Bluetooth chip starting from Bluetooth 4.2 can transmit and receive a B signal. That's every device in the last decade at least. For example, BLE is used by the Signal app to enable moving the app from one device to another.

**11:10** · And as I already mentioned, it is the same technology used by AirDrop and other NFC technologies. For this reason, it is actually easier to just build an app to listen to B directly on the phone.

**11:26** · The problem The problem of course is that the emission is a data leak. Now, this data leak is already dangerous because Apple and Google can use it as a supplementary location tracker to do contact tracing.

**11:41** · As I've already explained in a multitude of videos, Google and Apple specifically do 24/7 location tracking. So, they always know where you are and there's really no way to turn this off. This is how Find My Phone works and it's also used by Apple to remind you where your car is parked. The original technology used for location tracking is based on Wi-Fi triangulation, which is plenty accurate. But at its most accurate, it can pinpoint your location within 6 ft at best and likely further away if you're indoors.

**12:13** · But B tracking is different. The reason it is more accurate is that the data from the signal also can be used to compute a heading. So there's not even a need to triangulate as the exact heading is known. Triangulation as a concept just means that multiple devices have to supply data to arrive at a particular location data point. With BLE, there's no need. So, you can get an accurate location with one phone nearby. With two dozen phones nearby, well, we're getting into super accurate mode.

**12:44** · You can probably use it as a ruler, just like Apple is able to do. This means a B signal is very effective for things like contact tracing. Well, someone would have to guess if you're near a particular person. With a BLE signal, it would be obvious if you're having a conversation with someone. Thus, if we have another pandemic crisis, the government of California can go identify us individually from big tech and lock us up if we don't conform.

**13:12** · California big tech companies, of course, were first to implement contact tracing apps, though now this new technology is on steroids. Depending on the device, the MAC address reported by BLE may or may not be permanent. It depends on the device. iPhones will keep a MAC address for 15 minutes. That's their B implementation. Some devices like appliances and earphones retain a permanent MAC address.

**13:40** · While Apple may be happy with randomizing a MAC address, unfortunately, that solution does not grant you any safety. And that's because inherent in the BLE signal is the location. So I know who's at my neighbor's house because the location specifies it. I can just use the MAC address to have some temporary identifier. But the location is the main identifier. I also know the model of the device. That is obvious from the MAC address even if it is randomized because MAC addresses identify a model.

**14:13** · So, I know my neighbor has an iPhone 14, an iPhone 15, an Apple TV, and an Air Tag.

**14:22** · I can also see who's walking in front of my house and their walking path. Oh, and I see my neighbors are not currently home. I will know if those devices move since I can track them individually.

**14:35** · Knowing the device model and the location gives me a ton of information.

**14:41** · Fracking BLE.

**14:44** · To track B means you have to load some app from the Foid store. This means you have to install Foid on your Android phone. And if Foid is not already on your phone, you can download it from foid.org.

**14:57** · If you have a D Google phone of some sort, like a Bra 2, Brack 3, or a Doogle Pixel, then you already have FDroid pre-installed. If you're on an iPhone, well, unfortunately, you can only be a victim as there's no solution for you.

**15:12** · You can only do counter surveillance from an Android phone. And understand this part. If you're on a production Google Android, then you're also emitting a B signal. So, you can also be tracked. But if you're on a D Google phone, then you have no signal. You are invisible. There are several apps that can do B tracking, but today I'm going to focus on one which seems to give the most data. It is called BLE Radar.

**15:36** · The BLE radar is more powerful as it accepts all BLE in the airwaves regardless of source and does not filter it like some of the other apps like air guard. So I will focus on using this. It can be a bit complex to use but that is the nature of the devices being tracked. By the way, BLE Radar is also available on the Google Play Store. So it can be installed even without Froid.

**16:05** · using BLE radar.

**16:08** · I'm just going to get you going with the basics here of this app. There are many advanced features that's going to take a long time to explain, but you will appreciate what the basics can do.

**16:17** · Before starting BL Radar, go to the settings on Android and delete the history if you have used this before.

**16:25** · Then give it permissions to use locations even in the background. This app is from Foid and is open source, so there is really nothing to be concerned about.

**16:41** · You can always do a long tap on the app icon and select for stop when you're not using it. This way, it's not using up battery. Now, start the app and note the options at the bottom, which are device list, radar, profiles, journal, and settings. First, go to settings. Be aware that by default, some phones, like the BR 3 may default to a fused location instead of GPS position. I would use GPS position to get the most accurate data on the positions of your targets.

**17:12** · But realize that indoors GPS does not work.

**17:18** · So, the location of your targets will work better outdoors. Indoors the locations are to be considered as estimates. I would also select deep analysis here as this will try to identify the device a little better for you. To use this app, go to the main display which is the device list and then hit the scan button near the bottom. This will begin to scan for BLE signals around you. Unlike the other apps I've seen, this does not filter.

**17:47** · So, it really looks for any device emitting BLE, but that could even be a wireless headphone, an Apple TV, a Ring camera, a Samsung washer and dryer.

**17:57** · First thing I want you to observe as you watch it settle down and get data is that the devices of interest to you are the ones with a specified distance, and those are really the only active devices you need to focus on. If they don't have an active distance shown, then they're not actively being pinged or have disappeared from the list. The first problem you will find is the clutter.

**18:19** · There are too many devices and it is hard to analyze. Most devices, particularly iPhones, will change MAC addresses every 15 minutes or so. This means they appear in the list for 15 minutes at the maximum and then they disappear from the list and a new one appears. You may get frustrated with this, but this is why you need to focus on a couple of markers. first the distance and then you click on the device and see the location. The location is the true ID. If there's no distance, then they're not active.

**18:49** · So, you can ignore them. Now, if you look closely, the app identifies a MAC address type, and they show three colors with labels, RPA red, RST yellow, and STP green. The ones in green are static MAC addresses, which means they are fixed devices like Apple TV and can be ignored. The ones that are most elusive are the red ones and they are actually your target. They are the ones that are likely to be iPhones or Air Tags.

**19:19** · Often the model of the iPhone will be known and will be displayed to you. There are some advanced features here, but I'll just hit a few basic tips. First, you want to remove the clutter. The best way to do that is to isolate devices that you know about like your own trackers or your own appliances. The way to remove them is to assign those items a tag name. I would also tag items with a green STP icon which as I said are fixed devices like TVs.

**19:49** · For example, use a tag name of safe or home.

**20:02** · \[Music\] \[Music\]

**20:30** · Then you add a filter at the top using the add filter button. And as I do here, I click on not and then tag name and I pick home. So not home. So now all items marked as home will not display. Then I can focus on foreign devices.

**20:55** · \[Music\] \[Music\] Second, make a tag for suspicious devices like the ones in red. So my tag name here is target.

**21:25** · I flag the target devices so I can easily see them.

**21:30** · But again, the main thing to focus on is the distance. If no distance is specified, ignore them. Are they moving?

**21:38** · Are they in the same spot? Within a 15-minute range, while the MAC address is active, you can see the location of the device. So, you know your neighbor has an iPhone 14 and an iPhone 15.

**21:51** · If the Apple device is past 15 minutes of detection, ignore it, and it is likely the new one above it, and the distance will disappear anyway. So, that's your clue.

**22:03** · The unmarked red ones are likely Air Tags.

**22:07** · Now, watch the moving ones. After a while, if you keep this going, you will see a pattern of devices around you. And what you're looking for is something out of pattern within the distance specified. At least from indoors, I seem to be able to scan around 50 m around me, which is approximately 160 ft. And that is scanning from my indoors to my neighbors indoors.

**22:32** · outside you should get a wider range.

**22:34** · The specs say up to 200 meters.

**22:38** · So again, watch the characteristics of the devices here. The MAC addresses are only valid for 15 minutes, so you don't have a permanent identifier, but you will know where each device is located and potentially the type of device.

**22:51** · There's enough to see if someone is hiding around a corner or sitting in a car. At least from my experience, I'm spotting more iPhones than any other device, and these are the ones broadcasting the most. So, they're the most vulnerable. In the US, 57% of households have iPhones. So, I wouldn't be surprised if some areas would be 80% iPhone based. Except for my household, all my relatives are on iPhones. This app has more advanced features that you can experiment with.

**23:21** · The author's English isn't particularly good, so the explanations aren't obvious, but there are options to see if a device is always following you, at least within a 15-minute interval. If you're on the road, that would be suspicious as it would indicate that someone popped an Air Tag on your car or someone is physically following you. For a better viewing experience, always set the phone to allow rotation so that you can look at the map in landscape mode and have a more accurate and bigger view.

**23:56** · Other apps, there are other apps that track BLE. One that concentrates on Apple Air Tags, iPhones, and Trackers is Air Guard, also from Foid. After using this, I find that it filters too much information and limits itself to displaying Apple products mostly. So, you will likely miss things with this if you're trying to go on digital offense. There are other products on Google Play Store if you search for B radar or Aurora store.

**24:26** · And many of them are paid and have prettier interfaces. Some have a sensor that that allows you to search for them by showing if the signal is getting stronger or weaker. But as far as raw data is concerned, BLE Radar has the most comprehensive data, though a little clunky to use and not the prettiest UI summary.

**24:52** · After using this for a while and getting used to watching patterns and looking only at items with distances and filtering out house appliances, you really get a sense of the movements of people and devices around you. If you're concerned about this being used against you, reconsider your use of iPhones and store your headphones and wireless earphones when moving around. Try this app so you can get a sense of how vulnerable you are and you can start managing your radio emissions profile.
